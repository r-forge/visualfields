v0.0-1 11/22/2011
visualField is born!!!

Created the folder structure and description as Ken Knoblauch's "psyphy"

Created the skeleton with main functions, data, and documentation

v0.0-2 12/07/2011
visualField is almost ready to go!!!

Implemented all necessary functions to generate normative values

Implemented functions to obtain total-deviation (TD) and pattern-deviation (PD) values, and their corresponding probability maps (in relation to the normative values used)

Implemented functions to obtain global statistical measures for a visual field

Added a global variable nv (nv.rda) that contains the actual normative values to be used. This is to be set by newly created function setnv(). This is a better way to manage which version of normative values is used by visualFields. The function getnv() gives the actual version used by visualFields

Need to implement vfi

Need to add normative values also for mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, vfi, etc

Exhaustive testing is necessary

No display functions yet, but soon

v0.1-0 12/12/2011

Implemented vfi

Added normative values also for mean deviation, pattern standard deviation,  and vfi

Added a function that obtains demographics and statistics of the sample in vf object

Created a function that obtains TD-rank curves and functions that obtains normative values for TD-rank values

Exhaustive testing is still necessary

No display functions yet, but soon

v0.1-1 12/14/2011
some patches fixed

separation between visualFields and visualFieldsDevelIMF, a development package by IMF of functions that will be part of visualFields in the future

Each developer can have their own visualFieldsDevelXXX mounted on top of visualFields that updates it

v0.1-2 01/29/2012
added a series of function to parse XML files. Contributed by Richard Russell

added calculation of probability values for global indices

v0.1-3 03/01/2012
added functionality for pattern 30-2 and 10-2. NO NORMATIVE VALUES EXIST FOR THESE!!!! SO NO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS POSSIBLE

added a function to obtain from XML files the (x,y)-coordinates of the locations tested

v0.1-4 03/23/2012
added layouts and graphs for plotting visualFields results

v0.2-0 02/02/2012
finished first version of printouts and added stimulus-location and bebie-curve graphs

partially added PoPLR analysis. Contributed by Neil O'Leary

added Paul Artes' lego plots. Contributed by Paul Artes

v0.2-1 05/04/2012
fixed a few of bugs, a HIPAA problem, and left-eye, right-eye problems
completed PoPLR printout a bit more. Still need to confirm with them they are all right with it
