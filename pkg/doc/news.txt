v0.0-1 11/22/2011
visualField is born!!!

Created the folder structure and description as Ken Knoblauch's "psyphy"

Created the skeleton with main functions, data, and documentation

v0.0-2 12/07/2011
visualField is almost ready to go!!!

Implemented all necessary functions to generate normative values

Implemented functions to obtain total-deviation (TD) and pattern-deviation (PD) values, and their corresponding probability maps (in relation to the normative values used)

Implemented functions to obtain global statistical measures for a visual field

Added a global variable nv (nv.rda) that contains the actual normative values to be used. This is to be set by newly created function setnv(). This is a better way to manage which version of normative values is used by visualFields. The function getnv() gives the actual version used by visualFields

Need to implement vfi

Need to add normative values also for mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, vfi, etc

Exhaustive testing is necessary

No display functions yet, but soon

v0.1-0 12/12/2011

Implemented vfi

Added normative values also for mean deviation, pattern standard deviation,  and vfi

Added a function that obtains demographics and statistics of the sample in vf object

Created a function that obtains TD-rank curves and functions that obtains normative values for TD-rank values

Exhaustive testing is still necessary

No display functions yet, but soon

v0.1-1 12/14/2011
some patches fixed

separation between visualFields and visualFieldsDevelIMF, a development package by IMF of functions that will be part of visualFields in the future

Each developer can have their own visualFieldsDevelXXX mounted on top of visualFields that updates it

v0.1-2 01/29/2012
added a series of function to parse XML files. Contributed by Richard Russell

added calculation of probability values for global indices

v0.1-3 03/01/2012
added functionality for pattern 30-2 and 10-2. NO NORMATIVE VALUES EXIST FOR THESE!!!! SO NO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS POSSIBLE

added a function to obtain from XML files the (x,y)-coordinates of the locations tested

v0.1-4 03/23/2012
added layouts and graphs for plotting visualFields results

v0.2-0 02/02/2012
finished first version of printouts and added stimulus-location and bebie-curve graphs

partially added PoPLR analysis. Contributed by Neil O'Leary

added Paul Artes' lego plots. Contributed by Paul Artes

v0.2-1 05/04/2012
fixed a few of bugs, a HIPAA problem, and left-eye, right-eye problems
completed PoPLR printout a bit more. Still need to confirm with them they are all right with it

v0.2-2 07/26/2012
seriusly reworked the documentation of the package and added relevant references

changed defaults for vfplot

fixed a bug in loadvfcsv

added an example. Subject 1021

v0.2-3 08/15/2012
amended function bebie

improved functions vflayout_poplr, vflplot_poplr, vfplotloc so that they now admit several versions to mark "clinical significance" and "statistical significance"

added two functions that make operations on vf-objects: vfsort, and vfselectvisit

added another function that creates legend for rings, ringmapgraph

v0.2-4 09/16/2012
finished documentation

added a "expected number of years blind" in PoPLR analysis

v0.2-5 10/08/2012
fixed bug in vflayout_legoplots

v0.2-6 10/17/2012
fixed bug in vlplotloc

v0.2-7 11/11/2012
In plots of visual sensitivities show <0 for negative values and a couple of patches

v0.2-8 11/13/2012
removed unreliable controls from the normative values. Added option to capitalize tags or not in xmlblock and xlmitem functions

v0.2-9 12/01/2012
a patch in hist_poplr.R

v0.2-10 12/03/2012
Adapted PoPLRs to accept analysis with TD and PD values. Also added the possibility for a truncation value

v0.2-11 01/18/2013
change vflayout_poplr and vfplot_poplr to show years to blindness instead of years blind

v0.2-12 01/18/2013
created an environment vfenv to fix setnv(), so that nv is no longer in the .GlobalEnv which R does not allowed to modify from within a function

added 10-2 Wyatt, et al control data

generated 10-2 normative values from the control data
changed name standard for some datasets
